The plaintiff entered into a rental agreement with the defendant on March 1, 2022, for a commercial property in Bengaluru. The agreement clearly stated that the rent of ₹50,000 must be paid by the 5th of every month. The defendant has failed to pay rent for four consecutive months despite multiple notices served.

The plaintiff now seeks recovery of unpaid rent amounting to ₹2,00,000 along with interest and legal costs, as per Clause 5 and Clause 12 of the agreement.

There is no dispute regarding the existence of the agreement, and the defendant has acknowledged receiving the legal notices but has not responded with any counterclaims.

The plaintiff requests summary judgment based on breach of contract and non-payment.
